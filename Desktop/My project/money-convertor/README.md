# Currency Converter App

## Description

The **Currency Converter App** is a simple React-based application that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies. It uses the [Exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) API to fetch live exchange rates. Users can input the amount, select the base currency, and choose the target currency to see the converted value.

This project uses **Material UI** for the user interface components.
